Hey.. how are you? 

Could be better.. my phone died and my car just got towed so i'm using WhatsApp web.. could you come pick me up?

I'm actually in the middle of work right now sorry.. could you wait about 30 min? 

But it's raining

So just wait a bit I can't just walk away in the middle of a work right? 

I don't understand why you have to reply like such an ass. Every time you ask me for something I do everything I can to
do it I mean it seems like my whole life I'm just running around to please you and you never do anything for me and even when
you do it's like your doing me a favor I don't need favors from you I can take care of myself so never mind don't come at all.






I have to say sometimes your responses come across a bit harsh. Whenever you ask for my assistance,
I truly make an effort to help, but it feels like I'm constantly striving to meet your expectations. I would appreciate if
we could find a more balanced way to communicate.
I'm independent and capable of taking care of myself, so you don't have to feel obligated to pick me up.
I'd be happy if next time you'd reply with a little more patience and empathy.
